# WGAN

https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-wasserstein-gan-wgan-gp-6a1a2aa1b490

In practice, GAN can optimize the discriminator easier than the generator. Assuming the discriminator is already optimal, when minimizing the GAN objective function, if two distributions are very distant (i.e. if the generated image has distribution far away from the ground truth), the divergence would be large, but the gradient of the divergency would eventually diminish. We would have a close-to-zero gradient, i.e. the generator learns nothing from the gradient descent.

For GAN (the red line), it fills with areas with diminishing or exploding gradients.

For WGAN (the blue line), the gradient is smoother everywhere and learns better even the generator is not producing good images.

Two significant contributions for WGAN are
- it has no sign of mode collapse in experiments, and
- the generator can still learn when the critic (discriminator) performs well.

<br>

# WGAN-GP

https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-wasserstein-gan-wgan-gp-6a1a2aa1b490

1-Lipschitz Continuity means that the slope of every point on the W-Loss loss function is between -1 and 1.

Using the gradients on different real-fake mixture images with respect to the critic is an approximation for enforcing the gradient norm to be 1 at every point.

Wasserstein GAN requires enforcing the Lipschitz constraint, but GAN’s weight clipping has issues. Instead of weight clipping, WGAN-GP uses gradient penalty to enforce the Lipschitz constraint. Gradient penalty penalizes the model if the gradient norm moves away from its target norm value 1.

Batch normalization is avoided for the WGAN-GP’s critic (discriminator). Batch normalization creates correlations between samples in the same batch. It impacts the effectiveness of the gradient penalty.

<br>

# Conditional and Controllable Generation 

### Conditional Generation

For the discriminator, the class information is appended as extra channels (n classes for n channels), whereas for the generator, the class is encoded by appending a one-hot vector to the noise vector.
 
### Controllable Generation

Allows controlling the features of generated images (e.g. long hair) instead of controlling classes (as in Conditional Generation). Controllable Generation is done by tweaking the input noise vector.

Intended input noise vectors can be obtained using Classifier Gradients. In each iteration, the input noise vector is passed to a generator. Weights in the generator are frozen. A pre-trained classifier is used to classify if the output image is intended (e.g. long hair). Modify the input noise vector by gradient descent. Iterate until long hair emerges.

<br>

# Evaluation

A discriminator cannot be used for evaluation because it overfits to the generator it has trained with. The generator’s outputs, even look realistic, are classified as fake.

### Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)

From many (e.g. 50000) real image feature embedding vectors (Inception-v3 is used to extract the embedding vectors), calculate a mean and covariance matrix across all of them. Do the same for many fake images. FID looks at the real and the fake mean and covariance matrices, and calculates how far apart they are. The lower distance the better.
 
The shortcoming of FID are: (1) Inception-v3 does not capture all features, (2) FID is typically lower for larger sample sizes; the more sample there are, the better a GAN will seem to be, (3) Mean and covariance don't cover all aspects of the distribution.

Regarding FID Truncation: What fake images should we sample when evaluating with FID? Each noise vector is selected from a normal distribution centred around a µ of zero and has a standard deviation of one. When sampling a noise vector, values closer to zero occur more often. Close to zero values result in high fidelity images. Truncate the tails of the sample space, for a little less diversity and a little more fidelity.

 
### Inception Score (IS)

KL Divergence measures how different the conditional label distribution (fidelity) is from the marginal label distribution (diversity). KL Divergence is high when distributions are far apart, meaning that fake images each have a distinct/unambiguous label and there is also a diverse range of labels among those fakes. The lowest possible Inception Score is 1 and the highest / best possible score is 1000, the number of classes ImageNet has (Inception-v3 is trained on ImageNet). The Inception Score sums over all the images and averages over all the classes.

The shortcoming of Inception Score are: (1) cannot detect mode collapse, e.g. the model can just generate one realistic image for each class, (2) no comparison to real images, (3) poor score to images that are genuinely high entropy, e.g. multiple items exist in the image.

<img src="image/ProGAN_3.png" width="700"/>

（Also check out the Discriminator layer diagram from reference link)

- Apart from the high resolution, ProGAN can be trained about 2–6 times faster than a corresponding traditional GAN.
- The phasing in of a new block of layers involves using a skip connection to connect the new block to the input of the discriminator or output of the generator, and adding it to the existing input or output layer with a weighting. The weighting controls the influence of the new block and is achieved using a parameter alpha (α) that starts at zero (or a very small number), and linearly increases to 1.0 over training iterations.
- All layers remain trainable during the training process, including existing layers when new layers are added.
- The upsampling method is nearest neighbor interpolation, which is different from many GAN generators that use a transpose convolutional layer. The downsampling method is average pooling, which is different from many GAN discriminators that use a 2×2 stride in the convolutional layers to downsample.
- Batch normalization is not used; instead, minibatch standard deviation and pixel-wise normalization are used.
    - Minibatch standard deviation: The standard deviation of activations across images in the mini-batch is added as a new channel prior to the last block of convolutional layers in the discriminator. This encourages the generator to produce more variety, such that statistics computed across a generated batch more closely resemble those from a training data batch.
    - Pixel-wise normalization: Normalizes the feature vector in each pixel (of all channels) to unit length, and is applied after the convolutional layers in the generator. This is to prevent signal magnitudes going out of control.
- Equalized Learning Rate: Before every forward pass during training, scale the weights of a layer according to how many weights that layer has.
- Image generation uses a weighted average of prior models rather a given model snapshot, much like a horizontal ensemble.)
- The paper uses WGAN-GP as the loss function, but can use other loss functions.

# StyleGAN

<img src="image/StyleGAN.png" width="600"/>

- A 512 sized noise vector goes through a mapping network and turns into a same 512 sized intermediate noise vector, making the noise vector a less entangled feature representation.
- Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN): During the upsampling process, after each conv layer, apply AdaIN which has two steps:
  - Step 1: apply Instance Normalization to the convolution output.
  - Step 2: intermediate noise vector W derives two parameters (different parameters for each conv layer) to scale and shift the convolution output. Style information is transferred onto the generated image from W.
- Style Mixing: Use one intermediate noise vector W1 for AdaIN, and to control the style of the first half of conv layers (coarse styles), and use another intermediate noise vector W2 for the second half (fine styles).

<br>

# Pix2Pix

<img src="image/Pix2Pix.png" width="700"/>

- Pix2Pix is for Image-to-Image Translation (e.g. colorize black and white photos)
- Pix2Pix takes an image as input, instead of a class vector. Pix2Pix does not take noise as input.
- Generated output and its paired real image are concatenated along the channel dimension, and is fed to the PatchGAN discriminator.
- The PatchGAN discriminator outputs a matrix of values, each between 0 and 1. Use BCE loss.
- The generator wants the PatchGAN discriminator to think that every single patch of its generated image looks real, so use a Real matrix (full of 1’s). Use BCE loss.
- Apart from BCE loss, the generator also adds a Pixel Distance Loss term to its loss function, encouraging the generator to make images similar to the real.

<br>

# Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN)

When producing higher resolution images, SRGAN is more appealing to a human with more details compared with the similar design without GAN (SRResNet). During the training, a high-resolution image (HR) is downsampled to a low-resolution image (LR). A GAN generator upsamples LR images to super-resolution images (SR). A discriminator is used to distinguish the HR images and backpropagate the GAN loss to train the discriminator and the generator.

The loss is the weighted sum of a Content Loss and an Adversarial Loss. For the Content Loss, a VGG-19 network is used as a feature extractor, and each generated SR (fake) image’s VGG output and its original HR (real) image’s VGG output VGG are compared pixel-wise (and MSE is calculated). The only way that the fake image’s VGG output and the real image’s VGG output will be similar is when the input images themselves are similar.

# CycleGan

<img src="image/cyclegan_1.png" width="700"/>

<img src="image/cyclegan_2.png" width="700"/>

With unpaired Image-to-Image Translation, we have a pile of images in one style and another pile of another style. The Content is the common elements between two unpaired images.

https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-cyclegan-works/

The model architecture is comprised of two generators: one generator (Generator-A) for generating images for the first domain (Domain-A) and the second generator (Generator-B) for generating images for the second domain (Domain-B). The generator is similar to a U-Net.

    Domain-B -> Generator-A -> Domain-A
    Domain-A -> Generator-B -> Domain-B

Each generator has a corresponding discriminator model (Discriminator-A and Discriminator-B). The discriminator model takes real images from Domain and generated images from Generator to predict whether they are real or fake. The discriminator is a PatchGAN with Least Squares Adversarial Loss (not BCE Loss).

    Domain-A -> Discriminator-A -> [Real/Fake]
    Domain-B -> Generator-A -> Discriminator-A -> [Real/Fake]
    Domain-B -> Discriminator-B -> [Real/Fake]
    Domain-A -> Generator-B -> Discriminator-B -> [Real/Fake]

The loss used to train the Generators consists of three parts:

1. Adversarial Loss: Apply Adversarial Loss to both the Generators, where the Generator tries to generate the images of its domain, while its corresponding discriminator distinguishes between the translated samples and real samples. Generator aims to minimize this loss against its corresponding Discriminator that tries to maximize it.

2. Cycle Consistency Loss: If we translate the image from one domain to the other and back again, it should look the same as the original one. Hence, it calculates the L1 loss between the original image and the final generated image (summing the pixel differences). It is calculated in two directions:

        Forward Cycle Consistency: Domain-B -> Generator-A -> Domain-A -> Generator-B -> Domain-B
        Backward Cycle Consistency: Domain-A -> Generator-B -> Domain-B -> Generator-A -> Domain-A

3. Identity Loss (me: this is optional): It encourages the generator to preserve the color composition between input and output. This is done by providing the generator an image of its target domain as an input and calculating the L1 loss between input and the generated images.

        Domain-A -> Generator-A -> Domain-A
        Domain-B -> Generator-B -> Domain-B

Popular applications: (1) Image-to-image translation: Translate images from one domain to another, for example, from sketches to photographs. Useful for generating training data for machine learning models. (2) Domain adaptation: Adapt a model trained on synthetic data to real data. (3) Data augmentation. (4) Anomaly detection: Often used in medical applications. (5) Denoising

### Why don't we just denoise in a single large step?

For low noise, denoising is easy. For high noise, denoising is hard; the results tend to be blurry.

### Class-Conditioned UNet

If the image shape is (bs, 3, 28, 28), and class embedding size is 4 (i.e. 4 numbers are enough to encode all classes), then the class embedding shape is (bs, 4, 28, 28) (i.e. same 4 numbers for each pixal), and the concatenated shape is (bs, 3 + 4, 28, 28)

### Fine-Tuning

Fine-tune a trained diffusion model (trained on a dataset from the same or a different domain) on a target dataset, so that it can generate target images.

### Guidance

While a conditional model can takes additional inputs to control the generation process, the Guidance technique can control a trained unconditional model, i.e. the generated image at each step in the generation process is pushed to lower loss according to the guidance function (a user-defined loss function). Specifically, calculate the gradient of this loss with respect to the current noisy x and use this gradient to modify x before updating it with the scheduler.

For example:

    def loss(generated_image, prompt_text)
        image_features = openai_clip_model.encode_image(generated_image)
        text_features = openai_clip_model.encode_text(prompt_text)
        return distance between image_features and text_features

### Classifier-Free Guidance (CGF)

During training, text conditioning is sometimes kept blank, forcing the model to learn to denoise images with no text information (unconditional generation). Then at inference time, make two separate predictions: one with the text prompt as conditioning and one without. Then use the difference between these two predictions to create a final combined prediction that pushes even further in the direction indicated by the text-conditioned prediction.

### Stable Diffusion Text to Image Sampling Process

During training, it is worth mentioning that a pre-trained VAE encoder is used to generate VAE latent tensors as inputs to a U-Net (rather than using full-resolution images) for lower memory usage, fewer layers needed in the U-Net, and faster generation time.

During sampling, a U-Net that takes (1) text embedding (transformed from a prompt), (2) noise (random numbers in the shape of the VAE latent tensor), (3) timestep, and outputs noise in the shape of VAE latent tensor which is then decoded (using a pre-trained VAE decoder) into an image.

### Stable Diffusion Img2Img Sampling Process

An Img2Img pipeline first encodes an existing image into a latent tensor, then adds some noise to the latent tensor, and uses that (instead of pure random numbers) as the noise input of the U-Net. Img2Img is for preserving the image structure.
